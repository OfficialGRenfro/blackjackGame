My repository for a Blackjack Game I'm building from scratch

I'm creating this repo has both as my first public project on my Github and to better learn Python. 
I'm using My AI Guy's Python Pioneer's Youtube series as the primary way I am learning this language.

**ROADMAP**

BlackJack 1.0:
  Basic Foundation for the project - Console based Blackjack Game that tracks both the Dealer and Player's Cards. Record both value and suite of cards, tracks if Player or Dealer Busts,
  has Blackjack, or Wins or loses the game. 

BlackJack 1.1:
  Implement looping processes into the BlackJack Game. Allow the player to play multiple times in a row using the same deck of cards, gradually getter smaller over time. Add in reshuffle() 
  function to enable the ability to reset the deck between games. 

Blackjack 1.2:
  Introduce betting, track player bets, total amount of chips, and payment to player based on winning (3/2 for blackjack, doubling down, etc)

Blackjack 1.3:
  File read/write capabilites to store data on the local machine between play sessions, allowing the player to build up a large bank of money over time, or lose it all. 

Blackjack 1.4:
  Introduce multiple players, with unique programmable names and chip amounts. The ability to split cards, possibly even side bets.

Blackjack 2.0:???
  Adding graphical utility, taking the game from a console based game to a standalone mouse and click application.
